            <p> The wildlife in Sri Lanka is vast and includes various plant and animal species. 
              Sri Lanka has many protected areas that aid in conserving these species, many of which are scarce and endangered. 
              The country has a tropical climate with a lot of yearly rainfall. 
              Hence, the wildlife found here are mostly species used in tropical climates. 
              The various national parks in Sri Lanka are the best places to witness these beautiful creatures in their wild habitats.</p>
